Installation
============

Try:
::

    $ pip install tral


The TRAL configuration files are automatically added to your home directory:
::

    ~/.tral/



In case you install TRAL with sudo, the installation home might differ for the sudo account.
You can either supply the path to your home directory during installation ...:
::

    $ python setup.py install --home /path/to/your/home


or mv the TRAL configuration directory from your root dir to your home.
